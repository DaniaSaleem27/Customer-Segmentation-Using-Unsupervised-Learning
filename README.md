# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Unsupervised-Learning
Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

Approach

Loaded the Mall Customers Dataset and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and distributions in income and spending behavior.

Selected key features such as Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1–100) for clustering.

Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Implemented K-Means Clustering to group customers into segments.

Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for 2D visualization of the clusters.

Analyzed each cluster to understand behavioral traits and spending capacity.

Proposed personalized marketing strategies for each segment.

Results and Findings

The optimal number of clusters identified was 4, representing distinct customer segments.

Cluster Insights:

Cluster 1: High income – High spending → Premium Customers

Cluster 2: High income – Low spending → Careful Spenders

Cluster 3: Low income – High spending → Impulsive Buyers

Cluster 4: Low income – Low spending → Budget Customers

Each group reflects unique purchasing behavior and requires different marketing strategies such as loyalty programs, targeted promotions, or premium membership offers.

Conclusion:

The K-Means model effectively segmented customers into meaningful clusters, providing valuable insights for data-driven marketing decisions.

This approach enables businesses to design more focused and profitable marketing strategies based on customer behavior.
